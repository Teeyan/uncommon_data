# UNCOMMON HACKS 2018 Most Innovative Hack WINNER
This project won most innovative hack for UChicago's 2018 Hackathon! Thanks to all the judges for their hard work and the opportunity to bring this meme dream to fruition. 

# uncommon_data
Visualize csv datasets with Ugandan Knuckles Tribes using Principle Component Analysis and pandas/scikit-learn.

# Use Case
The python script is self contained in a flask application so running the server on localhost will enable you to try it out!

In addition we have an Amazon EC2 instance up and running but it may be taken down in the future. You can try it out here (if it still exists) : http://ec2-54-167-140-161.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

# Caveats
Obviously the nuances of doing data visualization in this manner is such that results are not always going to be pristine. For best results approach this with datsets geared towards clustering tasks that contain primarily continuous attributes. We are trying to expand the platform and will hopefully increase verbosity in the future.
